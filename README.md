# Troubleshooting

*Before trying to report a bug, please make sure you have tried those steps.*


0.  If you have error like `MissingMethodException: ` - you have an **outdated** version of the mod (unless there just was a huge patch and there are also many reports like yours).

1.  Make sure you run the **latest version**.

    - *You can find your version in your mods list if you are using **Mod Manager** and issue with other mod.*
    
    - In other case: check the **.dll** version number (right-click -> Properties -> Details), .dll files of the mods are located inside the mod folder, for example: \mods\Steam\1843965353\ (where 1843965353 - mod id from steam, which can be found by fight click on mod steam page - copy url)

    *You can find the latest available version:*

    -   On the mods steam page

    -   In the `Change Notes`

    -   In the `#announcements` channel on my **[Discord]**.

    <br>
    
3.  <ins>Disable all other mods</ins> (you can leave other my mods enabled)
    <br>
    
4.  Clear the mods cache by **deleting all files** inside the `/mods` folder while the is closed.

    <br>

5.  If the problems still persist, make a report.

# How to Report Bugs


1.  Head over to the **[Issues]** tab.

2.  Open a new issue with the following:

    -   The OS you are running.

    -   The games version number.

        *Should be displayed at the bottom of the games screen.*

    -   !!! **Provide mod version you have**

        *Can be found in the modlist or by right clicking the `.dll` ➞ check properties.*

        *P.S. Make sure you do not report issue on the outdated version.*

    -   Add the `[mod] X_X_X` as first part of the title of your issue. Example: `[DGSM] 1.2.3`

    -   Describe your problem.

    -   Describe how to reproduce it.

3.  Attach a game save file that has only been run with the mod you are trying to report a problem for.
